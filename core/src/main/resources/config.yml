# Items may be given a property that prevents/punishes players for using equipment that is too far above their own skill
# level. Example: if a level 0 light weapons player uses a 250 quality netherite sword before level x its effect will be
# greatly reduced
# The following formula outputs a multiplier that's applied on the given penalties with the purpose to reduce the
# penalty the closer the player gets to the intended usage level, and remove them once they've reached it.
# By default, this formula roughly gives the full penalty until the player has reached half the intended level, then it
# starts reducing more rapidly. At 90%, this penalty is halved. At 96% it's a quarter, at 98% an eighth.
# %fraction_level% is equal to PLAYERLEVEL / INTENDEDLEVEL, so if an item's intended level is 70 but the player is only
# level 35, this will be 0.5.
# Example: a netherite sword is configured to "require" light weapons level 80 to be used properly, the player is only
# light weapons level 60 so the player is 75% of the way there. The formula with this number outputs 0.9, so the player's
# damage is (-0.7 * 0.9) = -0.63 = 63% weaker
