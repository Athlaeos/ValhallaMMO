# Calculates how much the player difficulty level of the area is. By default, a singular player will have a regional difficult the same as
# their power level, but with multiple players it will be a bit higher than the average.
# Example, a level 10 and 50 player: their true average would be 30, but with the formula 60*1.2-0.2 = 72, 72/2 = 36 their area level will be about 36
# If undefined, the true average will be used.

global: # Stats for all entities. Entities specified in the `entity` section can also be given stats, which overwrite the global and default stats when present.

  # %level% may be used as placeholder, but for creatures with no level (passive mobs or players for example) they will have a level of 0
