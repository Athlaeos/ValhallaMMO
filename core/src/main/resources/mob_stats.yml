# Calculates how much the player difficulty level of the area is. By default, a singular player will have a regional difficult the same as
# their power level, but with multiple players it will be a bit higher than the average.
# Example, a level 10 and 50 player: their true average would be 30, but with the formula 60*1.2-0.2 = 72, 72/2 = 36 their area level will be about 36
# If undefined, the true average will be used.
