| `throwVelocity` | Throwing speed multiplier. Works on splash- or lingering potions, but also snowballs, ender pearls, eggs, etc. |
| `lingeringRadiusMultiplier` | Radius multiplier of lingering potion clouds. The amount of times an effect can be absorbed scales with radius, so radius also increases effectivity |
| `lingeringDurationMultiplier` | Duration multiplier of lingering potion clouds. Influences duration of the cloud itself, not the effects it gives |
| `splashIntensityMinimum` | Represents the minimum fraction of the duration of splash potions when affecting entities, regardless of distance. Usually the duration of a splash potion drops off dramatically the further away from the explosion an entity is, this number puts a minimum value on that |

| `potionCombiningAmplifierMultiplier` | A multiplier on the amplifiers of each potion effect involved when two potions are merged together using the potion merging ability |
| `potionCombiningDurationMultiplier` | Likewise, a multiplier on the durations of each potion effect. |

|  |  |
| The following stat is defined with a boolean (`true`/`false`) |  |
| `potionCombiningUnlocked` | Whether the potion combining mechanic is unlocked for the player or not. Potion combining allows players to right-click one potion onto another in their inventory to merge its effects, typically at a minor loss in duration |
|  |  |

| `unlockedTransmutations` | Represents the transmutations unlocked that alchemic precursor can use for transmutations.
