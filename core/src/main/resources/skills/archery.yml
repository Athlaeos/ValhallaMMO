# Arrows shot from a non-fully charged bow
# The default vanilla formula is ceil(%velocity% * %arrow_basedamage% * (1 + 0.25 * %power%))

# Every time the arrow damages an entity, its damage is reduced by the following factor
# (default 0.2, meaning the arrow damage is reduced by 20% for each entity hit)
# This is to make it so that when an arrow pierces multiple entities, it weakens a little with each pass
damage_piercing_reduction: 0.2

# The distance between shooter and target can increase the damage on an arrow, but to prevent this from being exploited
# to one-shot targets there's a limit to how far this damage can go.
# The damage increase is not predefined in configs, it is determined in the player's profile
# Distances beyond this amount will not affect the damage of shots further
distance_limit: 50

# Minimum velocity for a charged arrow to create a sonic boom (pretty much just there to make sure a sonic boom can only be created on a fully drawn bow)

# Archery damage can get extremely high with all the multiplicative damage sources that are available
# This is intended to reduce end-game damage so it becomes more balanced
# After the amount of damage specified in diminishing_returns_limit, any excess damage is multiplied by the amount
# specified in diminishing_returns_multiplier
diminishing_returns_limit: 30
diminishing_returns_multiplier: 0.2
# Example: if an arrow were to do 100 damage to a target, the excess over 30 damage (being 70) would be multiplied by
# 0.2, and so the shooter would instead do 44 damage
