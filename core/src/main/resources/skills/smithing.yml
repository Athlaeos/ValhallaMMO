quality_rounding_precision: 10 # Item's qualities will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the given number, this is to reduce on the inconsistencies between individually crafted items

quality_lore: # Lore placed on the item once its quality score equals or exceeds the given value PLUS the item material's intended
  # pivot point quality. Bit difficult to put into words, but here's an example:
  # Diamond gear surpasses vanilla level past a quality of 70, and I've decided "good" should be vanilla level.
  # That means diamond gear will be judged "great" if it's 50 quality points higher than that decided pivot point of 70, so 120.
  # Diamond gear will reach "peerless" if it surpasses 250 quality points beyond 70, so 320

# Tags
# Tags are simply numeric tags applied to the item.

tag_lore: # The tag lores displayed on the item. If one is left empty, it is not displayed.
