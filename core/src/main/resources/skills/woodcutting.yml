# As part of the tree capitator ability the plugin must be able to identify a block as a tree. It does this by checking the blocks above
# the mined log and checking if any leaves exist connected somewhere on top of the tree. This limit defines how many logs it's allowed
# to scan before giving up.
# In short, if a tree has more logs than this, it's no longer considered a tree that can be mined with tree capitator.
tree_scan_limit: 128

forgiving_multipliers: true # drop multipliers below 0 will, if false, sometimes cause blocks mined to not drop anything.
# if true, the drop amount can not go below 1 so only blocks that drop multiple items (such as redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore,
# gold/iron ore with fortune) will be affected, but everything else will drop at least 1.
# This may be set to false if you desire a more grindy experience for your players, though it might be frustrating for them
