field_harvest_instant: false # If true, field harvesting breaks blocks instantly (as opposed to few blocks at a time)
field_harvest_limit: 256 # Maximum amount of blocks the Field Harvesting special ability is allowed to break

forgiving_multipliers: true # drop multipliers below 0 will, if false, sometimes cause blocks mined to not drop anything.
# if true, the drop amount can not go below 1 so only blocks that drop multiple items (such as redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore,
# gold/iron ore with fortune) will be affected, but everything else will drop at least 1.
# This may be set to false if you desire a more grindy experience for your players, though it might be frustrating for them
