  # a to b. You don't have to work with this, it's only for those who really want to make this progression their own.
  # By default, it takes about 4300 exp to get from 0 to 20, 27,000 to get from 20 to 40, 164,000 from 40 to 60,
  # 1,000,000 from 60 to 80, and 6,300,000 from 80 to 100- or 7,500,000 from 0 to 100.
