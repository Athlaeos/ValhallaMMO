experience: # Everything about leveling and experience progression for Archery
  max_level: 100 # Max level for archery, players can still gain exp after reaching 100
  exp_level_curve: '0.25 * (%level% + 300 * 2^(%level%/7.6)) + 300' # Here the x-axis represents level and the y-axis is the exp required to
  # progress to that level.
  # The area under this graph from point a to point b represents the total amount of experience needed to get from level
  # a to b. You don't have to work with this, it's only for those who really want to make this progression their own.
  # By default, it takes about 4300 exp to get from 0 to 20, 27,000 to get from 20 to 40, 164,000 from 40 to 60,
  # 1,000,000 from 60 to 80, and 6,300,000 from 80 to 100- or 7,500,000 from 0 to 100.
  bow_exp_base: 10 # amount of exp gained from hitting a target with an arrow shot from a bow
  crossbow_exp_base: 12 # amount of exp gained from hitting a target with an arrow shot from a crossbow
  damage_exp_bonus: 0.1 # Fraction of extra experience per damage dealt, 0.1 will give the player 10% more experience per 1 damage. 40 damage results in +400% exp
  distance_exp_multiplier_base: 1 # fraction of exp gained if target is shot at a distance of less than 10 blocks
  distance_exp_multiplier: 0.75 # fraction of additional exp gained per 10 blocks of distance between you and the target
  # example: if you're 50 blocks away from a target you shot with a bow you gain 0.25 * 80 exp
  # plus an additional (0.75 * 5) x 80 exp resulting in 320 exp gained from that shot
  distance_limit: 100 # the distance cap to this exp multiplier, since it would otherwise be possible to shoot at an
  # entity and teleport hundreds of thousands of blocks away before the arrow hits to gain an absurd amount of exp
  # from a single arrow. By default this cap is 100, or a max of 6x exp
  infinity_multiplier: 0.7 # experience multiplier from arrows shot by an infinity bow
  spawner_spawned_multiplier: 0.7 # experience multiplier from mobs spawned from a monster spawner
