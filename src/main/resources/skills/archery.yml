# The distance between shooter and target can increase the damage on an arrow, but to prevent this from being exploited
# to one-shot targets there's a limit to how far this damage can go.
# The damage increase is not predefined in configs, it is determined in the player's profile
# Distances beyond this amount will not affect the damage of shots further
distance_limit: 50

# Sound that plays when the player activates charged shot. If this is invalid, no sound is made

# Sound that plays every time the player shoots a pierced shot. If this is invalid, no sound is made

# Particles that float around the player indicating the amount of charged shots they have active. If this is invalid, no particles are made

# Particle type of the sonic boom effect made after a charged shot is shot. If this is invalid, no sonic boom is made

# Minimum velocity for a charged arrow to create a sonic boom (pretty much just there to make sure a sonic boom can only be created on a fully drawn bow)
charged_shot_sonic_boom_required_velocity: 2.9
# Determines if special arrows (like enderic, incendiary, unholy) should have particle trails or not

# Archery damage can get extremely high with all the multiplicative damage sources that are available
# This is intended to reduce end-game damage so it becomes more balanced
# After the amount of damage specified in diminishing_returns_limit, any excess damage is multiplied by the amount
# specified in diminishing_returns_multiplier
diminishing_returns_limit: 30
diminishing_returns_multiplier: 0.2
# Example: if an arrow were to do 100 damage to a target, the excess over 30 damage (being 70) would be multiplied by
# 0.2, and so the shooter would instead do 44 damage
