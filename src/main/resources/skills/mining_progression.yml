  # a to b. You don't have to work with this, it's only for those who really want to make this progression their own.
  # By default, it takes about 4300 exp to get from 0 to 20, 27,000 to get from 20 to 40, 164,000 from 40 to 60,

    # Items will only reward experience if both the mined block and the associated drop exist in this list (I.E. IRON_ORE and RAW_IRON)
