forgiving_multipliers: true # drop multipliers below 0 will, if false, sometimes cause blocks mined to not drop anything.
# if true, the drop amount can not go below 1 so only blocks that drop multiple items (such as redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore,
# gold/iron ore with fortune) will be affected, but everything else will drop at least 1.
# This may be set to false if you desire a more grindy experience for your players, though it might be frustrating for them

# Digging features some archaeology buffs, one of them being that with a % chance, when a block is mined or dug out, adjacent blocks
# that aren't touching air may be converted to suspicious sand/gravel containing some loot.
# Materials are formatted like MATERIAL:MULTIPLIER, where the multiplier indicates how much the conversion chance should be multiplied
# per material. This allows more fine control over which blocks should more or less commonly be converted. (default multiplier 1)

archaeology_valid_vacinity_structures:
  # Due to some unfortunate spigot functionality, detecting a structure  the normal way currently completely ignores the max range
  # it's supposedly given, and so it's possible for these structures to freeze the server if they happen to be thousands of blocks away.
  # I implemented a much faster method of structure detection, but it relies on NMS and is therefore not usable on every version. If you're on
  # a not-yet compatible version keep this in mind, and that you might have to disable this feature.
  # These freezes usually happen once per area, so it's not gonna freeze the server super frequently or permanently, but they will happen
  # and any distances given will be inaccurate because Minecraft ignores them.
  # If you want this functionality disabled, empty the list of comment them out.

  # The digging skill also has a stat buffing the chances to find suspicious sand or
  # gravel if nearby a structure, here are valid structures this can occur around
  # Structures are defined as STRUCTURE:RANGE:LOOT_TABLE, where RANGE is a whole number corresponding to the chunk range a location must be to be considered "within" that structure
  # Structures that haven't been discovered yet will not be considered, even if they are within the radius. (default radius 2, default loot table trail ruins rare)
  # The following loot tables are archaeology-related, but any loot table from the LootTables enum can be used.
