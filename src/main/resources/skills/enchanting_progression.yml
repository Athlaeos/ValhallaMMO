  # progress to that level.
  # The area under this graph from point a to point b represents the total amount of experience needed to get from level
  # a to b. You don't have to work with this, it's only for those who really want to make this progression their own.
  # By default, it takes about 4300 exp to get from 0 to 20, 27,000 to get from 20 to 40, 164,000 from 40 to 60,
  # 1,000,000 from 60 to 80, and 6,300,000 from 80 to 100- or 7,500,000 from 0 to 100.
  # If you feel progressing is too slow with certain enchantment types, bump its enchantment_base value up. If you think these
  # default values are unbalanced, let me know so I can adjust them for those getting the plugin in the future!

  diminishing_returns:
    # Diminishing returns reduce the amount of enchanting experience you get depending on the amount of a specific
    # mob you have killed. Each kill of a mob in the category "on" increases the player's tally counter by 1,
    # if the tally counter value is more or equal than the amount specified in "amount" the amount of experience is
    # multiplied by the value specified in "multiplier". After enchanting, the tally counter is reduced by the "amount"
    # until the tally counter is below the "amount".
    # Example: a player kills 55 endermen. The next 5 times the player enchants something, their skill experience rewarded
    # is reduced to only 20% (multiplier of 0.2). Now their tally counter is 5 instead of 55, so their experience isn't reduced.
