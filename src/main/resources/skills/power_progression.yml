experience: # Everything about leveling and experience progression for Smithing
  exp_level_curve: '(%level%/100) * 1800 + 800' # Here the x-axis represents level and the y-axis is the exp required to
  # progress to that level.
  # The area under this graph from point a to point b represents the total amount of experience needed to get from level
  # a to b. You don't have to work with this, it's only for those who really want to make this progression their own.
  # By default this exp curve is linear, meaning each level adds a consistent amount of exp required to progress to the
  # next level. By default, it takes about 170,000 exp to reach level 100. If each skill levelup grants 100 exp, which
  # it does by default, you'd need to level 17 skills to level 100 to reach player level 100. By default there are
  # 13 skills (premium has 17) so you'd either need to re-do 4 skills or max all the premium skills to reach lv100.
  max_level: 256 # Max level allowed
  exp_gain: 100 # Experience gained whenever the player levels any skill
