# Calculates how much the player difficulty level of the area is. By default, a singular player will have a regional difficult the same as
# their power level, but with multiple players it will be a bit higher than the average.
# Example, a level 10 and 50 player: their true average would be 30, but with the formula 60*1.2-0.2 = 72, 72/2 = 36 their area level will be about 36
# If undefined, the true average will be used.

# rand() cannot be used here

default: # Mob stats for all entities. Mobs specified in the `entity` section can also be given stats, which overwrite the default stats when present.
  # For example, zombies receive -100% radiant resistance. This overwrites the default 100% radiant resistance.
  # By default mobs get 50% crit damage, this is added to the zombie's stats unless the zombie has crit damage specified also.
